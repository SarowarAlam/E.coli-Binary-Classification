## GitHub Report for E. coli Classification

### Project Overview
This project involves the classification of E. coli using a binary classification model developed in Python within Jupyter Notebook. The project leverages transfer learning with the ResNet50 model, achieving high accuracy in detecting E. coli from microscopic images. The implementation integrates data augmentation, model customization, and GUI-based practical applications.

### Key Features
1. **Dataset**:
   - The dataset consists of microscopic images of E. coli and non-E. coli samples.
   - Data augmentation techniques are employed to enhance the dataset by applying random transformations such as rotations, shifts, and flips, using `ImageDataGenerator`.

2. **Modeling Approach**:
   - **ResNet50 Base Model**: A pre-trained ResNet50 model is used with ImageNet weights. Custom layers are added to adapt the model for binary classification, including GlobalAveragePooling2D, a dense layer with ReLU activation, a dropout layer, and a sigmoid output layer.
   - **Compilation and Optimization**: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Callbacks like `ModelCheckpoint`, `EarlyStopping`, and `ReduceLROnPlateau` are implemented for efficient training and prevention of overfitting.

3. **Evaluation and Results**:
   - Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - The model achieves 95.71% accuracy, successfully classifying test images unseen during training.
   - Visualizations like confusion matrix and training/validation plots provide insights into model performance.

4. **User Interface**:
   - A GUI application built with Tkinter allows users to load images and perform E. coli detection interactively.
   - Predicted classifications ('E. coli' or 'Not E. coli') are displayed below each image with a summary of results.
